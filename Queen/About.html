        "Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals),"+
        "Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass guitar). Their earliest works were"+
        "influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into"+
        "more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.";

            The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions",
            which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium
            rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their
            1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum
            in the US. Their performance at the  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkFHYODzRTs&t=0s" target="_blank">1985 Live Aid concert</a>
            has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at
            Knebworth, England. Click  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV7XvG7fgm0" target="_blank"><b>Here</b></a>  if you want to check the full concert.

            Throughout the years, no other rock band has conquered the world and the charts like Queen.
            Starting in the early seventies and throughout the eighties, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger
            Taylor and John Deacon have written hit after hit. From their first number one single, Bohemian
            Rhapsody, to their stadium anthems, "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", their music has
            reigned across the radio airwaves from Great Britain and Europe to the United States and Australia.
            They have reached audiences in South America (where they were the first rock band to embark on a stadium
            tour) and in Hungary (where on their Magic Tour, they played to a sell out crowd, while still under the Iron
            Curtain). As the nineties approached, Queen focused their energies from touring to recording. The Miracle and
            Innuendo proved to be some of Queen's finest moments. They began to pick up new fans across the world, and according
            to many critics, were returning to the glory days of A Night at the Opera and News of the World. Unfortunately, on November 24, 1991,
            that new found steam came to a halt, as Freddie Mercury passed away, due to complications from AIDS.

            Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making
            them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award
            for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Phonographic Industry. They
            were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles,
            and all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the Ivor
            Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.
            In 2018, they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
